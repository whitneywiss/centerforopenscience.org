                                      What does it mean to have impact? For researchers it means pursuing knowledge, wherever it leads. For funders it means supporting research projects that advance knowledge and meet their institutional mission. <strong>Both are under pressure to deliver game-changing research to justify investments.</strong>

                                      Emerging good practices are providing opportunities for funders to improve research efficiency and nudge the incentives toward a more open, reproducible research culture.

                    <h4>Travel Awards</h4>
                    <p>The Doris Duke Charitable Foundation has generously provided funds to support a limited number of travel awards to cover a portion of meeting participants travel costs.  Should limited travel and conference budgets hamper your ability to attend this meeting you may apply for one of 15 travel awards of up to $500 per individual.   We wish to support as many organizations as possible with this grant  and will distribute these funds with a preference to funding one award per organization. However, should funds allow, an organization may request and receive multiple travel awards. Travel awards will be reviewed and funded in the order they are received.</p>
